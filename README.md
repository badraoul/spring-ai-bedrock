# Deploy Basic Spring AI app with AWS Bedrock 
This is an attempt to recreate a [quick Spring AI tutorial](https://youtu.be/yyvjT0v3lpY?si=fJb1ZVz5dY3o4n-a) demo that Dan Vega did on youtube.   

I am trying to swap out OpenAI for [AWS Bedrock using Cohere](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/clients/bedrock/bedrock-cohere.html) model based on the Spring AI documentation.

Not being a Spring developer, I have had to rely on the "*monkey see monkey do*" style of development.  
That is, I just copied whatever Dan did on the video and hoped to recreate with a different AI model.

This repo is the result.
